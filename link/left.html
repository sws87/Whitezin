W/&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Projects 
<br>(With Projects), White Zinfandel <br>is devoted to the visual <br>manifestation of food and culture <br>produced within the lives of <br>creative individuals. Interested in<br> the intersections between the <br>various creative fields, White <br>Zinfandel is the continuation of <br>a curatorial experiment, coupling <br>food and art as a reliable means <br>of provoking unexpected <br>reactions, cravings and curiosities.<br><br>
                
The theme of food extends to the <br>launch of every issue, with a <br>curated dinner concepted by the <br>reactions of the chef. The dinner <br>itself is an opportunity to create <br>a more immersive artistic <br>experience for the invited <br>community of fine artists, writers, <br>architects, curators and designers.<br><br>
                
White Zinfandel is not only a <br>limited edition publication that is <br>carefully curated every issue. It <br>also houses services that include <br>branding, marketing and design <br>consultation. We also concept <br>innovative collaborative projects <br>with other institutions, <br>organizations and brands.</p>
