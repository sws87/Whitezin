(With Projects), White Zinfandel is devoted to the visual manifestation of food and culture produced within the lives of creative individuals. Interested in the intersections between the various creative fields, White Zinfandel is the continuation of a curatorial experiment, coupling food and art as a reliable means of provoking unexpected reactions, cravings and curiosities.<br><br>
                
The theme of food extends to the launch of every issue, with a curated dinner concepted by the reactions of the chef. The dinner itself is an opportunity to create a more immersive artistic experience for the invited community of fine artists, writers, architects, curators and designers.<br><br>
                
White Zinfandel is not only a limited edition publication that is carefully curated every issue. It also houses services that include branding, marketing and design consultation. We also concept innovative collaborative projects with other institutions, organizations and brands.</p>
